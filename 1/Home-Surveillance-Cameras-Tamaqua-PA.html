<p>Setting aside the really apparent advantage of securing your home, here are 5 factors to buy a wireless security camera if you're still captured on the fence. Wireless security systems are typically thought about more trustworthy than they were even just a few years back. With improved efficiency and reliability, they use lower installation costs and much easier upgrades than wired systems.

However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not offer you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.

<p>The second wireless function has to do with how your security system interacts with the alarm monitoring station. Older security systems would use a home phone line to dial out" and interact with the alarm monitoring station. Nevertheless, many families no longer utilize a phone line in their home.
