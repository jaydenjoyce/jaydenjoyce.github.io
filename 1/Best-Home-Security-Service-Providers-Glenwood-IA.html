<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to keep and the length of time you plan to keep taped video. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly.
