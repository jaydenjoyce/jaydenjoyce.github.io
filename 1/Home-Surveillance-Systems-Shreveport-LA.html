<h3>Commercial Security Service Shreveport LA 71106</h3>
<p>There are 2 main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet procedure (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras. IP cameras are the more contemporary model of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a bit more costly, they provide a variety of features that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the differences between the two kinds of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they used to be.

Bullet cameras are round and long in shape and are perfect for outdoor usage. Their strengths lie particularly in applications which need long distance viewing. Set up within protective casings, the cameras are protected versus dust, dirt and other natural aspects.
