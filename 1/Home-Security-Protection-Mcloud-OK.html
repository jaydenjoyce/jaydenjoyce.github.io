<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

<p>SimpliSafe may be too restricted for you if you have a larger home or property you desire to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's currently readily available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is excellent for watching on visitors and package shipments, but it leaves other parts of your backyard susceptible. This system may not be the best fit if you have a big lawn or sheds to safeguard. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q doesn't require a base station-- it connects straight to any Wi-Fi network. But you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser.
