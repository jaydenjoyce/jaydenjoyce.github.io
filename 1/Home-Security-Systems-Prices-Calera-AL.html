Amongst the most popular are placing prized possessions out of sight and guaranteeing your home or business always looks occupied, even when you're away.

However a new study from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in collaboration with UCL has actually found that more light may not suggest increased safety.</p>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering numerous decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>Untidy and obvious wires encountering walls and floorboards are an eyesore - despite the situation.

However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
