<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of totally free storage, and use two AA batteries that can last up to two years. Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.
