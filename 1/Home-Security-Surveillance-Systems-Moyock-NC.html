<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Renters, unlike homeowners, generally avoid making irreversible modifications to their homes.

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
