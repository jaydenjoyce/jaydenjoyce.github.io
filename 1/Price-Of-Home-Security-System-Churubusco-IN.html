<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
