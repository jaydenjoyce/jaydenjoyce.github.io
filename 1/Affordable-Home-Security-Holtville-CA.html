Whether you're using a wireless IP-based system or subscribe to a security component as a part of a "wise home" package; these innovations depend on user passwords to equip and deactivate them.

Make sure to change the made password credentials right away upon receipt and replace them with a passphrase that can not be quickly thought. If you go on holiday and have someone coming by to examine or feed animals on your home, set a short-term password and reset it as quickly as you return.
