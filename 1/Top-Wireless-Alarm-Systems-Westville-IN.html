<p>After purchasing, setting up, and using these systems for eight months, we discovered four standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all supply an outstanding client experience and user-friendly, innovative security tech. We 'd be comfortable outfitting our own homes with any of them-- although each excels in a specific location. ADT offers remarkable brand name recognition (an effective crime deterrent), Vivint aces home automation, and Frontpoint offers a high-support alternative for those who desire a streamlined, Do It Yourself system.</p>
