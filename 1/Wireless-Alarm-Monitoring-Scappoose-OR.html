<p>No incorrect alarm charges: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm. Given that the homeowner is in charge of the system, cops are just contacted if there's a real emergency. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will get in touch with cops if a property owner can't confirm an incorrect alarm. If  cops are called for a false alarm, property owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching police needlessly. A self-monitored home limitations the potential for subsequent charges and false alarms.</p>
