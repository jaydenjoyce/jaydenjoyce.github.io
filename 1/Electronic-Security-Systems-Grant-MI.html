<p>As you begin trying to find a house alarm company, there are a number of things you need to watch out for. Continue with care when you're handling companies who install exclusive systems and claim that they just work with their certified monitoring systems. You should also keep an eye out for companies who won't let you change your passcode or switch to another company even after your agreement has actually completed.
