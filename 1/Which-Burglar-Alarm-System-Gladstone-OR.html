<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction. As soon as a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
