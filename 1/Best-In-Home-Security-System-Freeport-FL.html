The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal construction.

Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
