<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
