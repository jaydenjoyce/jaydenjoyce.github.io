<p>There was when a time when home security meant spending lavishly on high-end cameras, motion sensing units, and a professional set-up. Not anymore! Gone are those days of expert installation and a complicated buying procedure. With the arrival of contemporary technology you now have smarter and affordable home security systems that you can establish all by yourself. Safe Home Beginner is the basic package with window, motion, and door sensors. Safe Home Everyday uses extra sensing units, while Safe Home Plus includes glass break detection.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
