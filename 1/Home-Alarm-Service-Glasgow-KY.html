<p>What many people don't understand, however, is that there are a variety of different kinds of CCTV camera which suit different situations or facilities, and that choosing the correct camera for the right application really is important.

<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the reality, which suggests that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and take up a lot of tape-recording storage space. A lot, in reality, that they require about 4 times the hard disk area of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to invest more cash.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
