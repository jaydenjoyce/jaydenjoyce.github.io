The opportunity that the fixed camera would be pointed in the instructions of the occurrence depends on the initial requirements for location of protection. If there are three select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single fixed camera can just view one.

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
