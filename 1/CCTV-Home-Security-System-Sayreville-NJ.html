<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being viewed by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people may find out to be careful about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers." Indeed, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments underwent prolonged surveillance.</p>

<p>Many contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which enable operators to enjoy some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to search archived footage, and also enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several places. Frequently, the simple existence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated burglars. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more identified robbers. They might also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks if trespassers can not see any security cameras.</p>
