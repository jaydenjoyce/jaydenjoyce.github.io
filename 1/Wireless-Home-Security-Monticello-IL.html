<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again react to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating expensive false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating systems.

<p>No false alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the authorities for a false alarm.
