<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on offered bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
