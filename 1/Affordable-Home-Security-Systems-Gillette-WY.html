We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit minimal to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their mobility, expandability and impermanence. Tenants, unlike homeowners, normally avoid making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other parts can quickly be set up at various homes in the future, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new elements too.

Unfortunately I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Kid was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is actually great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
