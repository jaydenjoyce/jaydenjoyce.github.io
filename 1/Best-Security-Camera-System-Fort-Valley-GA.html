The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the malicious assailant to tape-record these codes and utilize different splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can launch a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security key recorded during the network healing.</p>
