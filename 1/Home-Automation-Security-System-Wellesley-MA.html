<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction.

Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
