Throughout 76 research studies, Piza and coworkers (2019) discovered that closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance had a statistically substantial influence on general crime (OR = 1.14).

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
