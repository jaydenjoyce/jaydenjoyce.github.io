<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
