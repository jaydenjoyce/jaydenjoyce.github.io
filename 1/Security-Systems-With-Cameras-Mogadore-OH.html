<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with a tempting opportunity for criminal misuse.

By looking up the license plate varieties of parking lot at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the cars' owners, he attempted to blackmail clients who were wed. Picture what someone like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
