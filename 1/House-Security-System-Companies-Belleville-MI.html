<p>While every property owner worries about break-ins, uncertainty has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complex agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically resulting in false alarms. ELERTS is a free smartphone app that enables people who see something suspicious to take a picture and quickly send it to public safety authorities. For instance, a public transit rider may notice someone behaving suspiciously. Many people are fiddling, texting or surfing with their mobile phones. With ELERTS, a user can discretely snap an image of the suspicious activity and send it to security officials with a couple of clicks. Reports from smart phone users can be rapidly reviewed and acted upon by Public Safety authorities.</p>
