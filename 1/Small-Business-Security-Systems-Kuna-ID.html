<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When people are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they may be enjoyed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "individuals may find out to be cautious about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers."

<p>This awesome clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly setting off when movement was spotted. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>
