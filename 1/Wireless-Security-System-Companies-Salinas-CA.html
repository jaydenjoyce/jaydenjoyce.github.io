<p>Another essential subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
