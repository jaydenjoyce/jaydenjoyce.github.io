The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the present pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four totally free false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
