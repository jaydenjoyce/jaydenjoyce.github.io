If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police response to alarmed properties) a ineffective and pricey technique to burglary decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
