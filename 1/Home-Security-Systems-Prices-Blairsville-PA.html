These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for short battery life by far.

<p>For smart home functions, we recommend the ADT Pulse plan.
