<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems typically include emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet.

My mind conceptualized an approach of not just supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their antiquated nurse call station system.</p>
