By combining LiveWatch Do It Yourself security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security competing with other big names in the market. During our hands-on screening of Brinks, we found the systems to be somewhat simple to set up and use-- but not quite as simple as brand names like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in client reviews, and it provides a crisp image approximately 32 feet.

Tech is supposed to make our lives easier and Hive's environment measures up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
