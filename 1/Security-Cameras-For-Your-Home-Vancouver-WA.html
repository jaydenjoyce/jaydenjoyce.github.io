<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
