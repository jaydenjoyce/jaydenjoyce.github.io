<p>Thanks to recent advancements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you have actually made the decision to install a burglar alarm, you should consider the following benefits of wireless technology.

<p>Big nationwide alarm companies such as ADT sometimes utilize exclusive communicators which will ONLY deal with their main station.
