<p>Besides resolution, also consider the field of vision. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are developed equivalent. Depending on the lens' field of view, it can see in between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big range in regards to the camera's vision cone. You should think about a camera with a very wide field of view if you want to enjoy a big location. The ability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is a terrific asset also.</p>
