<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft.

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
