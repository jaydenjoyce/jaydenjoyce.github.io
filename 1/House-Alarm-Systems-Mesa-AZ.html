<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
