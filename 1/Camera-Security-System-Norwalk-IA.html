With years of experience installing and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle homes and companies, we've built great relationships with both local police and their consumers.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
