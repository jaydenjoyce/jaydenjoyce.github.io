<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later created to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption plans, any client in the network that knows the secrets can read all the traffic.</p>

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
