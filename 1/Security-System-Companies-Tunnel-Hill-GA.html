This design also features a clever app that lets you see through the eyes of your cameras and quickly record at any time. On the downside, when motion detection is activated, its cameras are sometimes extremely sensitive and send out informs even if minimal motion outside has actually been spotted.</p>

It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send voice warnings through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of up to one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have noticed some enhancements since the camera's launch, and will continue to upgrade this review and check, as required.</p>

You will not have to stress about it tape-recording or sending out an alert every time the canine strolls by if the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic area. (We believe this is a more valuable feature if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks often pass.)
