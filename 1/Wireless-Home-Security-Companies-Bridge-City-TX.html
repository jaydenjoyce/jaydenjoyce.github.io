<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense avoidance created to prevent both personal and residential or commercial property criminal offense and can be used in place of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will minimize criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other nearby locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

My mind conceptualized a method of not just offering the customer with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>

The only outdoor security camera that's presently offered is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is terrific for watching on visitors and plan shipments, however it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable.
