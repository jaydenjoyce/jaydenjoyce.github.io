<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, should provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly cost ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to effectively find motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with taping spaces during important security events.
