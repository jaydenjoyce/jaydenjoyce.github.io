<p>Thanks to current developments in technology, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you've made the decision to install a burglar alarm, you should consider the following benefits of wireless technology. For some, that may deserve the $300 price. But while we like the clever functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Cam IQ, many of the cameras we looked at deal the same advantages at a more sensible rate.

<p>It's a top-notch bundle but it's costly, and to get the most out of it (like cloud storage archives or motion zones) you truly require to sign up for a subscription too.
