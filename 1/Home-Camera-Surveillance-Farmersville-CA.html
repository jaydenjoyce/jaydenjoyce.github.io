You might even give instructions on how to enter your building. As just recently as ten years earlier, customers did not have access to technology that let them handle their own home security systems. Smart alarm changed that. Originally, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, usually a home alarm company. The consumer paid month-to-month fees.</p>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems available today.

<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video photo; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
