<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
