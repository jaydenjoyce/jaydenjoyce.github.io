<p>In The Sims, a burglar alarm will cover a whole room when put indoors. It will cover a 5-tile radius if put on an outside wall. When a provider allows customers to monitor their own homes, this is called self-monitoring." Consumers can monitor their homes with the aid of motion detectors, sensors, and security cameras. In this case, the provider typically has a mobile app that consumers can utilize to get signals on their phones. In many cases, consumers can also inspect the app to see live video from security cameras.</p>
<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an offense. Once a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
