<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
