<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to cops capability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund authorities reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and ineffective  approach to burglary reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
