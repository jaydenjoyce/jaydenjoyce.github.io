<p>There are two outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped. The dome-shaped outdoor security camera is understood to be less obvious to unwelcome visitors since they provide a 360 swivel that makes it tough to determine their instructions. On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more typical. They have a cylinder shape that clearly stands out to alert thieves that your home is under surveillance.
