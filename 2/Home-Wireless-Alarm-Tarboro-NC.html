When the Floodlight camera spots movement, it switches on its 2 effective LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Camera also has a loud speaker, so you can talk with whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their reactions.

When choosing security cameras for your CCTV system, these are all important questions to be thought about.</p>
