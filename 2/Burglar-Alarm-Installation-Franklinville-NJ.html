However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
