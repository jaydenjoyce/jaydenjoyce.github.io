<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
