<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to man.

<p>Nevertheless, benefit doesn't necessarily feature included security. Going from wired to wireless security means possibly exposing yourself to outside attacks if you do not do it right. You don't need to go into a house to cut the wire with wireless," the way you would with wired security, warns Du.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
