This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key captured during the network healing.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
