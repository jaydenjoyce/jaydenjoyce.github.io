<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
