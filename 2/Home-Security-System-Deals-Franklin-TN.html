<p>Reliability is a highly subjective when it comes to technology matter, depending on which features and advantages an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, however low signal strength and poor connection are still common grievances.

<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve.
