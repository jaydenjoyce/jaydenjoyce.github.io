We actually enjoyed using Brinks' video features, and we like how their top-tier plan comes with an HD video doorbell for good measure.</p>
<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we tested, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an appealing cost and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each.

And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the month-to-month plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year. But if you desire the outright best when it comes to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
