<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store.
