When people are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they may be seen at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people may find out to be careful about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, drug addicts or members."
