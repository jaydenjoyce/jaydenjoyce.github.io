PTZ cameras are from another location managed, and allow the operator to pan (relocation left or best), tilt up and or down, or zoom better or further away in order to follow individuals as they move. This lets operators zoom in on specific locations or track specific motions. The cameras can also run patterns or turn to a pre-programmed position.</p>

We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
