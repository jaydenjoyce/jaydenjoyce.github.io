<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
