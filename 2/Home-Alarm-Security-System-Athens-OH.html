<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
