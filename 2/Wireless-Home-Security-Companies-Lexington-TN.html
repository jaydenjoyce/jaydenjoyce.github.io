<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month cheaper and been in business three years so I'm comfortable providing a try.
