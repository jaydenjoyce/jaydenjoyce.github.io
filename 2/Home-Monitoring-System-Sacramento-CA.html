<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
