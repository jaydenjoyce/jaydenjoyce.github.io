The Ring Floodlight Cam integrates two essential devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds motion, it turns on its two powerful LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Web cam also has a loud speaker, so you can speak to whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their reactions.

<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over two months. Scout is very simple to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it enables you to manage almost every element of the security system from another location, and it's extremely adjustable.
