<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting.

We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over two months. Scout is very simple to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones.
