<p>You can find two kinds of security systems: professionally monitored and unmonitored. In the previous, when an alarm goes off, an expert monitoring company receives an alert and after that tries to call you and, if need be, your local emergency services.

That means you need to be on night, call and day, during work and vacation time, and prepared to figure out whether cops, fire departments, or other emergency services need to be dispatched. Then, you need to make that call yourself. It's a big difference, and an expertly monitored system is fundamentally more secure than a self-monitored or unmonitored one.</p>
