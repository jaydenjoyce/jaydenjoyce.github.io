<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public spaces. When people are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they may be watched at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling.

You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals may learn to be mindful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They might likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang drug addicts, members or hookers."
