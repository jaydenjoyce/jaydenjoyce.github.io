<p>Ring might not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has actually gained quite the fanfare throughout the years. We have actually been checking Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring costs.

Skimping on door and window sensing units is the biggest error DIYers make. Trust us, the one window you skip, is the one window they'll select to enter. With a PTZ (Pan Tilt & Zoom) camera, your security group can have total control on what is taped. At the touch of a button, the camera lens can pan left and best, tilt up and down or zoom in and out. It's the ideal choice if you have a security guard who is monitoring a live video feed on site.</p>

Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So select what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the contract and enjoy those cost savings if you understand you'll stay put for at least three years. But if you may upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best choice.</p>
