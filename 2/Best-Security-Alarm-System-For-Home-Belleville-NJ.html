<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage choice and others don't. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; nevertheless, nothing is taped. The systems with video storage normally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage option conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself.

You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, especially for cameras. And to be truthful, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first location. What you're spending for is primarily that huge name in blue.</p>
