<p>Reliability has actually long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's a debate that's typically manipulated by factors such as uncertainty over the vulnerability of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and problems that trigger false alarms. While improvements in recent years have actually made the technology more robust and popular (some systems today have their own distinct wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns persist over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>The NVR removes these problems, because it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
