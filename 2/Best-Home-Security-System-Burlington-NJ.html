This system might not be the best fit if you have a big yard or outbuildings to safeguard. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not require a base station-- it links straight to any Wi-Fi network. However you can link the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is readily available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web internet browser.
