As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people may find out to be cautious about the regulars and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, members or hookers."
