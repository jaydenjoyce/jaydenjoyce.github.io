The latter allows you to see specifically when a particular individual comes to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has actually expanded its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99).
