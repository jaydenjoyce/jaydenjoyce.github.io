<p>CCTV cameras are much better at capturing crooks after they have actually committed a criminal offense, rather than having the ability to stop a criminal offense in development. Somebody has to be actively enjoying the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to try to detect criminal activity before it happens. Having a large number of noticeable CCTV cameras in public areas might function as some level of deterrent, understanding you are being recorded, though most likely not watched.</p>
<p>A lot of home security cameras carry out the same basic functions-- they find an event, record the event, and send you an alert-- but they do not all perform them the same way. And some cameras have special features that exceed those basics. Here are some common features you'll experience while shopping and why they are necessary (we've listed them in alphabetical order). In each of the reviews that follow this buyers' guide, we'll go over how each camera delivers on these features.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, typically via 110VAC power.</p>
