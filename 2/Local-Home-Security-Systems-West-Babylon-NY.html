I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter signals, for example. However, those features come at a relatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.
