<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also functions as a motion detector. It is equipped with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensing unit, so whenever there's some motion identified, it can send you a push notice in your phone so you can react to it immediately. Additionally, the motion sensor here is far more sophisticated than the ones provided by adobe Starter Package. Because it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it just gets activated when it captures motion from something giving off infrared energy, i.e., people and animals. In addition, it doesn't get set off by small objects. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has among the most innovative motion sensors that eliminate all incorrect alarms and just gets triggered when people approach it.</p>
