<h3>Camera Surveillance System Vancleave MS 39565</h3>

Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to effectively detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it might leave you with recording spaces during essential security occasions.
