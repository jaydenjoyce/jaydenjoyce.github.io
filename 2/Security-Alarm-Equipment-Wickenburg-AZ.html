<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
