Hard drive storage is safe, secure, and hassle-free, with lots of systems offering expansion and free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll require to manually eliminate to move the information? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the greatest security, you want the information to be backed up in numerous locations. Another factor is the number of days of video are archived.
