The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to effectively detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it might leave you with recording spaces during crucial security events. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd suggest among our top choices, but the Arlo is fantastic for signing in on family and pets-- or stray cats slipping around your lawn.</p>
