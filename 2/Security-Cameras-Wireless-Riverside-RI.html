It's a simple to use camera with a bunch of adjustable controls. It runs on a rechargeable battery, and has a weatherproof case that protects it from the components.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated smart home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, consisting of clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is pricey, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you don't dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>There was when a time when home security implied spending lavishly on high-end cameras, motion sensors, and an expert set-up. Not anymore!

Fortunately, surveillance doesn't need to be difficult. Keep reading to see the equipment and elements you'll need to get your IP surveillance system up and running.</p>
