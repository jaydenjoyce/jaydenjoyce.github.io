<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
