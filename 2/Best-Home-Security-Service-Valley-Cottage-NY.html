<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
