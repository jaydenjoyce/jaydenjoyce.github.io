<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, ought to supply a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more available for a month-to-month charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to properly identify motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.
