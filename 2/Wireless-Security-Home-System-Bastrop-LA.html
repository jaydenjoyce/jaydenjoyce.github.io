Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to burglary decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
