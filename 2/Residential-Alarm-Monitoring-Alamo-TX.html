(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But since the majority of retail theft would not journey an alarm anyhow (a staff member slipping some additional money while providing a consumer change, for example), we believe it's more important to have high-quality images so you have the proof you require. Which's what Nest provides you.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most economical monitoring plan beginning at $10. You can get all the basics like e-mail, sms, and push signals, as well as 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's most inexpensive, Constantly On" strategy.

This extra cost isn't ideal, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices each month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a take.</p>
