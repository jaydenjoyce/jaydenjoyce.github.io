<p>To determine reaction times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the specific very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.
