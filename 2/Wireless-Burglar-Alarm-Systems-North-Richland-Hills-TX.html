<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and scams. Tip: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again respond to the alarm; each response is billed.

For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically shut off the heater. If the motion sensing units are activated, you can instantly make the clever lights turn on to frighten potential burglars.</p>

The possible worth of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when detectives recognized the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sorting through video images recorded by the city's cameras.</p>

For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped. The systems with video storage generally include either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage alternative saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself.
