Low battery or irregular power source. Many wireless systems work on batteries which, if not altered frequently, can trigger an incorrect alarm. Regular power outages or change in voltage can also trigger incorrect alarms by harming the system and its sensing units.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, because it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
