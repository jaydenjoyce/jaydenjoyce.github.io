<p>Nurse calling systems generally consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's bathroom. He can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station if a patient is having trouble. This is an easy switch that is normally open or generally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and signals, sensors, gain access to control, and so on.
