<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
