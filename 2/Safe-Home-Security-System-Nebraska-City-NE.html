<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
