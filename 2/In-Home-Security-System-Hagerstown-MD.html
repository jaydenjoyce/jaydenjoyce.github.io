For $15 each month, you can include 24/7 professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive strategy includes control via iOS and Android mobile phone apps, push and email alerts, and 30-day event-footage storage for unlimited cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is available separately.
