<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one?

The infrared energy produced by a things is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of detecting tiny distinctions in temperature.

Since things are hardly ever exactly the exact same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
