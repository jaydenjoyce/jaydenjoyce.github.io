<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to save and the length of time you plan to keep documented video footage. The video footage is going to consume up storage space rapidly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage when you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>
