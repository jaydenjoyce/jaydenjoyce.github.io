As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
