<p>Home security systems and modern-day wise home capabilities and compatibilities enable you to tap into their sensors and cameras directly from your phone. Try to find a design that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range as much as 25 feet, and budget-friendly cloud storage for tape-recorded video. Sometimes it's practical to be able to see what occurred just before or after a visitor approaches your door.
