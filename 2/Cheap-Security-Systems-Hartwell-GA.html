<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with sophisticated smart home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, consisting of smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>Vivint uses both wireless sensing units and cellular communication in all of its security packages. It's the leading company in home automation technology and it develops most of its own equipment, consisting of the Vivint video doorbell.
