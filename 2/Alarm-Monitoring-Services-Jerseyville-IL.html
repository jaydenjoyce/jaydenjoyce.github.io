<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
