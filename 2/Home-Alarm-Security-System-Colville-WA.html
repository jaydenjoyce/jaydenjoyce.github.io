<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.

If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is set off. However, you might pick to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas).

<p>The majority of contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to enjoy some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video to digital, which helps to extend storage capacity, makes it much easier to search archived footage, and likewise enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from multiple locations. Often, the mere existence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated intruders. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or harmed by the more figured out intruders.
