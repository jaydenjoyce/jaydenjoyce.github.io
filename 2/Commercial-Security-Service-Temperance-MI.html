Nevertheless, individuals need to take into consideration the frequency and period of their lacks from home or business - rather than simply their tenancy. Who is home, when they are not? Who will hear and respond to the alarm? And so on. If that system is not monitored, less than half the protection the consumer anticipates is being provided.</p>
