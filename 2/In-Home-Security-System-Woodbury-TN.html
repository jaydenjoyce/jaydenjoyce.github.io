<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
