<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
